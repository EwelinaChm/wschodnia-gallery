# **Wschodnia Gallery**

This is the website of an art gallery in Lodz, Poland called Wschodnia, which is the name of the street where the gallery is situated. I decided to do a website for this art space because I've been co-running it for over 20 years. My reasoning is partially sentimental and partially practical - I have lots of texts and images about the place at my disposal.

The website is accessible and designed as mobile-first, using UX/UI principles.
