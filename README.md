# **Wschodnia Gallery**

This is the website of an art gallery in Lodz, Poland called Wschodnia, which is the name of the street where the gallery is situated. I decided to do a website for this art space because I've been co-running it for over 20 years. My reasoning is partially sentimental and partially practical - I have lots of texts and images about the place at my disposal.

The website is accessible and designed as mobile-first, using UX/UI principles.

## Design ##
There are 3 main, high-contrast colours used throughout the whole website: black, white and yellow which is the same colour scheme used in the design of the book about the gallery.
Oswald font is used for headings because it's very similar to the font used in the official gallery's printed logo: Impact. Merriweather Sans font used for text is a font that is very compatible visually with Oswald.
For designing the main structure of the website I've created wireframes using Balsamiq software.
